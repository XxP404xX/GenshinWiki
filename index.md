### GenshinWikiBot#6277
GenshinWikiBot is a Discord bot that was inspired by the rpg open world game, GenshinImpact, by the company miHoYo. GesnshinWikiBot provides a brief information for charcaters, artifacts, weapons, places and more. GenshinWikiBot information are all from [Genshin Impact Fandom](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/), so all info are valid and brief. We used a fan made API by [genshin.dev](https://api.genshin.dev/) to get info about weapons, artifacts and weapons. There are more commands and utilities to come very soon such as Genshin Impact OST radio, which we am working on it right now.
